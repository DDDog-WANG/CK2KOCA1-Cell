# research introduction 

- For master research, now, I am doing the classification system for telescope image of cells. My Lab is AIST Collaboration Laboratory, so I do my research with some biologist of AIST to get the telescope data. For now, I have used mask-rcnn to do segmentation that get each 1 cell from the whole image, and then creat classification model to recognize that cell is healthy or sick.
